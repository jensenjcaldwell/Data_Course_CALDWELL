We fitted a logistic model (estimated using ML) to predict ratio with gn (formula: ratio ~ gn). . The model's intercept,
corresponding to gn = [?], is at -2.60 (95% CI [-4.38, -1.41], p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of gnTRUE is statistically non-significant and negative (beta = -0.22, 95% CI [-2.48, 1.95], p = 0.838; Std. beta =
-0.22, 95% CI [-2.48, 1.95])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs)
and p-values were computed using a Wald z-distribution approximation.

I analyzed the data in R using a logistic model to examine the relationship 
between the use of gender-neutral language in tweets to the performance of a 
tweet measured by the ratios of likes and retweets to the followers of the twitter account.
There was no statisticall signifigant difference, although in the dataset the gender neutral tweets performed 22% worse.
